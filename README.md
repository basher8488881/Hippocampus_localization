# Hippocampi_localization_from_MRI_Scan
Hippocampus Localization Using two stage Ensemble Hough Convolutional Neural Network


# We have analyzed two dataset: GARD Cohort Dataset(326) and ADNI Dataset(351/343) 
# Using Hough Voting with Convolution Neural Network, we estimated the Hippocmapi locations.
